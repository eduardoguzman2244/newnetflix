### 🎬 My Little Netflix

This project is a simple movie database web application developed as part of a course midterm assignment.  
It follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) design pattern and uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to manage a list of movies directly in the browser via **localStorage**.

- 👀 Show movie details (title, director, image)  
- ✏️ Edit existing movies  
- ➕ Add new movies
